Overview
========

Compiling CAF requires CMake and a C++11-compatible compiler. To get and compile the sources on UNIX-like systems, type the following in a terminal:

::

   git clone https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework
   cd actor-framework
   ./configure
   make
   make install [as root, optional]

We recommended to run the unit tests as well:

::

   make test

If the output indicates an error, please submit a bug report that includes (a) your compiler version, (b) your OS, and (c) the content of the file ``build/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log``.
