Type Inspection (Serialization and String Conversion)
=====================================================

CAF is designed with distributed systems in mind. Hence, all message types must be serializable and need a platform-neutral, unique name that is configured at startup . Using a message type that is not serializable causes a compiler error . CAF serializes individual elements of a message by using the inspection API. This API allows users to provide code for serialization as well as string conversion with a single free function. The signature for a class ``my_class`` is always as follows:

::

   template <class Inspector>
   typename Inspector::result_type inspect(Inspector& f, my_class& x) {
     return f(...);
   }

The function ``inspect`` passes meta information and data fields to the variadic call operator of the inspector. The following example illustrates an implementation for ``inspect`` for a simple POD struct.

The inspector recursively inspects all data fields and has builtin support for (1) ``std::tuple``, (2) ``std::pair``, (3) C arrays, (4) any container type with ``x.size()``, ``x.empty()``, ``x.begin()`` and ``x.end()``.

We consciously made the inspect API as generic as possible to allow for extensibility. This allows users to use CAFâ€™s types in other contexts, to implement parsers, etc.

.. _inspector-concept:

Inspector Concept
-----------------

The following concept class shows the requirements for inspectors. The placeholder ``T`` represents any user-defined type. For example, ``error`` when performing I/O operations or some integer type when implementing a hash function.

::

   Inspector {
     using result_type = T;

     if (inspector only requires read access to the state of T)
       static constexpr bool reads_state = true;
     else
       static constexpr bool writes_state = true;

     template <class... Ts>
     result_type operator()(Ts&&...);
   }

A saving ``Inspector`` is required to handle constant lvalue and rvalue references. A loading ``Inspector`` must only accept mutable lvalue references to data fields, but still allow for constant lvalue references and rvalue references to annotations.

.. _annotations:

Annotations
-----------

Annotations allow users to fine-tune the behavior of inspectors by providing addition meta information about a type. All annotations live in the namespace ``caf::meta`` and derive from ``caf::meta::annotation``. An inspector can query whether a type ``T`` is an annotation with ``caf::meta::is_annotation<T>::value``. Annotations are passed to the call operator of the inspector along with data fields. The following list shows all annotations supported by CAF:

-  ``type_name(n)``: Display type name as ``n`` in human-friendly output (position before data fields).

-  ``hex_formatted()``: Format the following data field in hex format.

-  ``omittable()``: Omit the following data field in human-friendly output.

-  ``omittable_if_empty()``: Omit the following data field if it is empty in human-friendly output.

-  ``omittable_if_none()``: Omit the following data field if it equals ``none`` in human-friendly output.

-  ``save_callback(f)``: Call ``f`` when serializing (position after data fields).

-  ``load_callback(f)``: Call ``f`` after deserializing all data fields (position after data fields).

.. _backwards-and-third-party-compatibility:

Backwards and Third-party Compatibility
---------------------------------------

CAF evaluates common free function other than ``inspect`` in order to simplify users to integrate CAF into existing code bases.

Serializers and deserializers call user-defined ``serialize`` functions. Both types support ``operator&`` as well as ``operator()`` for individual data fields. A ``serialize`` function has priority over ``inspect``.

When converting a user-defined type to a string, CAF calls user-defined ``to_string`` functions and prefers those over ``inspect``.

.. _unsafe-message-type:

Whitelisting Unsafe Message Types
---------------------------------

Message types that are not serializable cause compile time errors when used in actor communication. When using CAF for concurrency only, this errors can be suppressed by whitelisting types with ``CAF_ALLOW_UNSAFE_MESSAGE_TYPE``. The macro is defined as follows.

.. _splitting-save-and-load-operations:

Splitting Save and Load Operations
----------------------------------

If loading and storing cannot be implemented in a single function, users can query whether the inspector is loading or storing. For example, consider the following class ``foo`` with getter and setter functions and no public access to its members.

Since there is no access to the data fields ``a_`` and ``b_`` (and assuming no changes to ``foo`` are possible), we need to split our implementation of ``inspect`` as shown below.

The purpose of the scope guard in the example above is to write the content of the temporaries back to ``foo`` at scope exit automatically. Storing the result of ``f(...)`` in a temporary first and then writing the changes to ``foo`` is not possible, because ``f(...)`` can return ``void``.
